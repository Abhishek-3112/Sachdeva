        <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-700 border-b-4 border-indigo-200 pb-2 mb-6">A. Digital X-rays (Radiograph)</h3>

        <p>Radiography is a type of imaging that uses electromagnetic radiation to view the inside of the body, especially bones and certain tissues. It is a fast, painless, and non-invasive diagnostic tool commonly used in medicine and dentistry. When computers are used to capture and display the images it is called digital radiography.</p>

        <p>At Sachdeva Diagnostics we use a High Frequency 600mA Xray Machine from Medtronics and the topend AGFA CR System for the digital X-rays</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">Safety Note:</h4>
        <p>X-rays involve ionizing radiation, but the dose is generally very low, especially when high powered  x-ray machines are used. The dose further reduces in digital radiography.</p>
        <p>Not recommended for pregnant women unless absolutely necessary. It is done after covering the baby with a lead shield.</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">Common Types of X-rays:</h4>

        <p><strong>Plain X-rays :</strong><br>
        • Chest X-ray : To examine lungs, heart, and chest wall.<br>
        • Abdominal X-ray : To check for bowel obstruction, stones or abnormal masses.<br>
        • Dental X-rays : To assess teeth, bone loss, cavities, or root problems.<br>
        • Bone X-rays : To detect fractures, dislocations, or arthritis.</p>

        <p><strong>Preparation:</strong>  Most plain xrays do not require any preparation and can be done any time. Except plain Xray of the KUB region where you are asked to take a laxative one night prior and come empty stomach the next day after your bowel has nicely cleared</p>

        <p><strong>Special X-rays:</strong><br>
        <strong>Orthopantomogram (OPG) :</strong><br>
        Panoramic dental X-ray for full jaw and teeth. Key Features:<br>
        • Panoramic View: Captures the entire mouth in a single image.<br>
        • Non-invasive: The patient simply stands biting on a mouthpiece; the machine rotates around their head.<br>
        • Quick and Painless: Usually takes less than a minute.<br>
        • Low Radiation: Relatively low dose compared to other radiographic methods.</p>

        <p><strong>Uses of OPG :</strong><br>
        • Evaluating tooth development and eruption patterns.<br>
        • Detecting impacted teeth (e.g., wisdom teeth).<br>
        • Planning for orthodontic treatments.<br>
        • Identifying jaw fractures, tumors, cysts, or infections.<br>
        • Assessing the bone structure for dental implants.<br>
        • Checking for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.</p>

        <p><strong>Contrast Xray Studies:</strong><br>
        • Xray studies after using a contrast medium :<br>
        IVP ( intravenous pyelography ), barium studies, HSG (Hysterosalpingography), sonogram / fistulogram</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">HSG (Hysterosalpingography):</h4>
        <p>HSG stands for Hysterosalpingography — a special type of X-ray procedure used primarily to evaluate the uterus and fallopian tubes in women, especially in cases of infertility.</p>
        <p><strong>When Is It Done?</strong><br>
        Typically performed between days 7 and 10 of a woman’s menstrual cycle (after menstruation, before ovulation)</p>
        <p><strong>Procedure :</strong> A cannula is passed into the cervix and contrast is injected through the cannula and xrays are taken subsequently.<br>
        At Sachdeva Diagnostics the procedure is done by Dr Savita Sachdeva who has a vast experience of doing nearly five thousand HSG procedures in the last 20 years.</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">Intravenous Pyelography (IVP):</h4>
        <p>Intravenous Pyelography (IVP) is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the urinary tract, including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, by using a contrast dye and X-rays.</p>

        <h5 class="font-semibold">Purpose</h5>
        <p>IVP is typically used to:</p>
        <p>• Detect location of Urinary Tract obstruction as in kidney stones or urinary tract tumor<br>
        • Investigate frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs)<br>
        • Assess structural abnormalities in the urinary tract</p>

        <h5 class="font-semibold">Preparation:</h5>
        <p>• You may be asked to fast for several hours and take a laxative to clear your bowels.<br>
        • Injection:<br>
        • A contrast dye is injected into a vein, usually in your arm.<br>
        • Imaging:<br>
        • As the dye travels through your bloodstream to the kidneys and urinary tract, X-rays are taken at timed intervals.<br>
        • Observation:<br>
        • The dye outlines the urinary structures, allowing doctors to observe their shape, size, and function.</p>

        <h5 class="font-semibold">Risks and Considerations</h5>
        <p>• Allergic reaction to the contrast dye (rare but possible)<br>
        • Not ideal for people with poor kidney function or iodine allergy<br>
        • Radiation exposure, though generally low</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">Barium studies</h4>
        <p>A group of diagnostic imaging tests that use barium sulfate, a contrast material, to help visualize parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</p>

        <h5 class="font-semibold">Types of Barium Studies</h5>

        <p><strong>Barium Swallow (Esophagogram)</strong><br>
        • Examines: Pharynx and esophagus<br>
        • Used for: Difficulty swallowing, GERD, strictures, tumors</p>

        <p><strong>Barium Meal / Upper GI Series</strong><br>
        • Examines: Esophagus, stomach, and duodenum<br>
        • Used for: Ulcers, hiatal hernia, gastric tumors</p>

        <p><strong>Barium Follow-Through</strong><br>
        • Examines: Small intestine<br>
        • Used for: Crohn’s disease, malabsorption, small bowel obstruction</p>

        <p><strong>Barium Enema (Lower GI Series)</strong><br>
        • Examines: Colon and rectum<br>
        • Used for: Polyps, diverticulosis, colorectal cancer, IBD</p>

        <h5 class="font-semibold">Preparation</h5>
        <p>• Fasting for several hours (usually overnight)<br>
        • For lower GI: Laxatives or enemas to cleanse the colon</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">B. Ultrasound Scan (also called a Sonogram) :</h3>

        <p>A non-invasive imaging test that uses high-frequency sound waves to create real-time images of structures inside the body.</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">How It Works:</h4>
        <p>A device called a transducer emits sound waves.</p>
        <p>These waves bounce off tissues and organs.</p>
        <p>The returning echoes are captured and turned into images on a monitor.</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">Key Features:</h4>
        <p>No radiation (unlike X-rays or CT scans)</p>
        <p>Safe for pregnant women and babies</p>
        <p>Provides real-time imaging (great for observing motion, like fetal heartbeat)</p>

        <p>At Sachdeva Diagnostics we use the latest technology RS 85 Prestige Whole Body Ultrasound Scan System from SAMSUNG; fully equipped with an array of probes: Convex, High frequency Linear, Intracavitary ( TVS, TRUS) and 3D/4D.</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">Common Uses of Ultrasound:</h4>
        <p>Obstetric: Monitor pregnancy, fetal growth, heartbeat, and position.</p>
        <p>Pelvic: Evaluate uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder</p>
        <p>Abdominal: Examine liver, kidneys, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen</p>
        <p>KUB: assess kidneys, urinary bladder, prostate.</p>
        <p>Vascular/ Colour Doppler: Check blood flow in arteries and veins</p>
        <p>Musculoskeletal: Look at muscles, joints, tendons, or soft tissue masses</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">Specialized Ultrasounds:</h4>

        <p><strong>1. 3D/4D Ultrasound:</strong>  shows organs / fetus in a  three dimensional view.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Transvaginal/Transrectal Ultrasound:</strong> Provides close-up internal views using special probes.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Color Doppler:</strong> A specialized type of ultrasound imaging that shows the flow of blood through blood vessels — including arteries and veins — using color-coded visuals.</p>

        <p><strong>Purpose of a Color Doppler:</strong><br>
        • Assess blood flow direction, speed, and volume.<br>
        • Detect blockages, narrowing or clots.<br>
        • Check fetal blood circulation in pregnancy<br>
        • Monitor organ perfusion (e.g., kidneys, liver, testicles)</p>

        <p><strong>Common Uses:</strong><br>
        • Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)<br>
        • Varicose Veins<br>
        • Carotid artery evaluation (stroke risk)<br>
        • Pregnancy: check placental and fetal blood flow<br>
        • Liver or kidney transplant assessment<br>
        • Testicular torsion evaluation</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">4. Shearwave Ultrasound (Shearwave Elastography)</h4>
        <p>Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) is an advanced, non-invasive imaging technique that measures tissue stiffness using ultrasound-generated shear waves. It’s especially useful for assessing liver fibrosis, tumors, and muscle conditions.</p>

        <h5 class="font-semibold">How It Works</h5>
        <p>• The ultrasound probe sends acoustic pulses into the tissue.<br>
        • These pulses generate shear waves<br>
        • The machine tracks how fast these waves move through the tissue:<br>
        • Faster waves = stiffer tissue<br>
        • Slower waves = softer tissue<br>
        • The result is a color-coded map of stiffness (an elastogram) over a conventional ultrasound image.</p>

        <h5 class="font-semibold">Common Uses</h5>
        <p>• Liver: ( Fibroscan)  Assess fibrosis and cirrhosis (e.g., hepatitis B/C, NAFLD)<br>
        • Breast: Alternative to liver biopsy in many cases. Distinguish benign vs. malignant lesions<br>
        • Thyroid: Evaluate suspicious nodules<br>
        • Prostate: Guide biopsies, assess stiffness in cancer-suspicious regions<br>
        • Muscles & Tendons: Detect strain, tear, or scar tissue<br>
        • Lymph nodes & tumors: benign vs malignant</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold">5. Fat Quantification (QUS) :</h4>
        <p>It assesses the amount of fat in the liver by two techniques: TAI (tissue attenuation index)  called by various names like CAP  or UGAP value and  TSI ( tissue scattering index ) and  then combines the two to give a Fat Fraction % (UDFF).</p>

        <p>Shearwave Ultrasound and Fat Quantification are used together to study the liver. While most cetres just give the tissue attenuation value
        (CAP / UGAP),  at Sachdeva Diagnostics we use the top end machines which gives  the Fat Fraction ( UDFF% ) also along with the tissue attenuation value.</p>
