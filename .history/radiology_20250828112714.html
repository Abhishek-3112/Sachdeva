      <p><strong>A. Digital X-rays (Radiograph)</strong><br>
      Radiography is a type of imaging that uses electromagnetic radiation to view the inside of the body, especially bones and certain tissues. It is a fast, painless, and non-invasive diagnostic tool commonly used in medicine and dentistry. When computers are used to capture and display the images it is called digital radiography.</p>

      <p>At Sachdeva Diagnostics we use a High Frequency 600mA Xray Machine from Medtronics and the topend AGFA CR System for the digital X-rays</p>

      <p><strong>Safety Note:</strong><br>
      - X-rays involve ionizing radiation, but the dose is generally very low, especially when high powered x-ray machines are used. The dose further reduces in digital radiography.<br>
      - Not recommended for pregnant women unless absolutely necessary. It is done after covering the baby with a lead shield.</p>

      <p><strong>Common Types of X-rays:</strong></p>
      <p>1. <strong>Plain X-rays :</strong><br>
      • Chest X-ray : To examine lungs, heart, and chest wall.<br>
      • Abdominal X-ray : To check for bowel obstruction, stones or abnormal masses.<br>
      • Dental X-rays : To assess teeth, bone loss, cavities, or root problems.<br>
      • Bone X-rays : To detect fractures, dislocations, or arthritis.<br>
      <em>Preparation:</em> Most plain xrays do not require any preparation and can be done any time. Except plain Xray of the KUB region where you are asked to take a laxative one night prior and come empty stomach the next day after your bowel has nicely cleared</p>

      <p>2. <strong>Special X-rays:</strong> <br>
      <strong>Orthopantomogram (OPG)</strong>:<br>
      Panoramic dental X-ray for full jaw and teeth. Key Features:<br>
      • Panoramic View: Captures the entire mouth in a single image.<br>
      • Non-invasive: The patient simply stands biting on a mouthpiece; the machine rotates around their head.<br>
      • Quick and Painless: Usually takes less than a minute.<br>
      • Low Radiation: Relatively low dose compared to other radiographic methods.</p>

      <p><strong>Uses of OPG :</strong><br>
      • Evaluating tooth development and eruption patterns.<br>
      • Detecting impacted teeth (e.g., wisdom teeth).<br>
      • Planning for orthodontic treatments.<br>
      • Identifying jaw fractures, tumors, cysts, or infections.<br>
      • Assessing the bone structure for dental implants.<br>
      • Checking for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.</p>

      <p>3. <strong>Contrast Xray Studies:</strong><br>
      • Xray studies after using a contrast medium : IVP (intravenous pyelography), barium studies, HSG (Hysterosalpingography), sonogram / fistulogram</p>

      <p><strong>HSG (Hysterosalpingography):</strong> a special type of X-ray procedure used primarily to evaluate the uterus and fallopian tubes in women, especially in cases of infertility.<br>
      <em>When Is It Done?</em> Typically performed between days 7 and 10 of a woman’s menstrual cycle (after menstruation, before ovulation)<br>
      <em>Procedure:</em> A cannula is passed into the cervix and contrast is injected through the cannula and xrays are taken subsequently.<br>
      At Sachdeva Diagnostics the procedure is done by Dr Savita Sachdeva who has a vast experience of doing nearly five thousand HSG procedures in the last 20 years.</p>

      <p><strong>Intravenous Pyelography (IVP):</strong> a medical imaging technique used to visualize the urinary tract, including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, by using a contrast dye and X-rays.<br>
      <em>Purpose:</em><br>
      • Detect location of Urinary Tract obstruction as in kidney stones or urinary tract tumor<br>
      • Investigate frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs)<br>
      • Assess structural abnormalities in the urinary tract</p>

      <p><em>Preparation:</em><br>
      • You may be asked to fast for several hours and take a laxative to clear your bowels.<br>
      • A contrast dye is injected into a vein, usually in your arm.<br>
      • As the dye travels through your bloodstream to the kidneys and urinary tract, X-rays are taken at timed intervals.<br>
      • The dye outlines the urinary structures, allowing doctors to observe their shape, size, and function.<br>
      <em>Risks:</em> Allergic reaction to the dye, not for poor kidney function or iodine allergy, radiation exposure though generally low.</p>

      <p><strong>Barium Studies:</strong> imaging tests using barium sulfate for the GI tract.<br>
      <em>Types:</em><br>
      1. Barium Swallow – Pharynx & esophagus<br>
      2. Barium Meal / Upper GI Series – Esophagus, stomach, duodenum<br>
      3. Barium Follow-Through – Small intestine<br>
      4. Barium Enema – Colon & rectum<br>
      <em>Preparation:</em> Fasting for several hours, laxatives/enemas for lower GI.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-10">B. Ultrasound Scan (Sonogram)</h3>
      <p>A non-invasive imaging test using high-frequency sound waves to create real-time images.</p>

      <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Transducer emits sound waves → echoes return → machine creates image.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
      • No radiation<br>
      • Safe for pregnant women and babies<br>
      • Provides real-time imaging</p>

      <p>At Sachdeva Diagnostics we use the latest RS 85 Prestige Whole Body Ultrasound Scan System from SAMSUNG, with Convex, Linear, Intracavitary (TVS, TRUS), and 3D/4D probes.</p>

      <p><strong>Common Uses:</strong><br>
      Obstetric, Pelvic, Abdominal, KUB, Vascular/Colour Doppler, Musculoskeletal.</p>

      <p><strong>Specialized Ultrasounds:</strong><br>
      1. 3D/4D Ultrasound<br>
      2. Transvaginal/Transrectal<br>
      3. Color Doppler – blood flow visualization<br>
      4. Shearwave Ultrasound (Elastography) – assess liver, breast, thyroid, prostate, muscles, tumors<br>
      5. Fat Quantification (QUS) – measures liver fat (TAI + TSI, gives Fat Fraction %)</p>

      <p>At Sachdeva Diagnostics we provide both Fat Fraction (UDFF%) and tissue attenuation (CAP/UGAP), unlike most centres.</p>
