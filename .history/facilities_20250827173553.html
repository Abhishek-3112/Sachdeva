  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">A. HEMATOLOGY</h2>
  Hematology is the branch of medicine that focuses on the study of blood, the blood-forming organs, and blood diseases. It involves the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of a wide range of conditions related to blood and its components, including:
• Red Blood Cells (RBCs) – Carry oxygen to the body's tissues.
• White Blood Cells (WBCs) – Fight infection.
• Platelets – Help with blood clotting.
• Plasma – The liquid portion of blood that carries cells and proteins.

Common Tests and Procedures in Hematology : 

a) CBC /  Hemogram :
Hemogram test also known as a complete blood count (CBC), is a comprehensive blood analysis that assesses various blood components. It helps doctors evaluate overall health, diagnose conditions like anemia, infections and blood disorders, and also monitors treatment effectiveness. 

What it checks:
• Red blood cells (RBCs): Measures the number of RBCs and their characteristics (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC count ,MCV , MCH.  MCHC ,RDW etc.).

• White blood cells (WBCs): Counts total and  different types of WBCs, which help fight infections.
( TLC , DLC, Absolute counts as ANC, ALC , AEC and AMC)

• Platelets: Checks the number  and morphology of platelets, essential for blood clotting.

• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) :  is an important marker of inflammation.

No preparation is needed for doing a Hemogram.

At Sachdeva Diagnostics :
For haemoglobin estimation, platelet count and CBC every patient’s blood sample is run in a fully automated haematology analyser and a blood smear slide is also prepared to be viewed manually by the  Pathologist for cross checking results and improving accuracy.

ESR is included in CBC for all patients as it is an important and useful marker.

b) Peripheral Blood Smear : is the microscopic analysis of the various blood cells by the Pathologist. It provides complete morphological details of the cells and helps in diagnosing type of anaemia, infections like malaria and blood cancers.

c) Coagulation Tests
A coagulation profile test, also known as a clotting profile or hemostasis test, assesses the blood's ability to clot properly. It helps diagnose bleeding or clotting disorders .

A coagulation profile typically includes the following tests: 

• Prothrombin Time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR)
• Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)
• Platelet Count:
• Bleeding Time (BT): This test measures how long it takes for small blood vessels to stop bleeding after a small cut. 
• Clotting Time (CT): This test measures the time it takes for blood to clot in a test tube. 

Why is a coagulation profile test done?
• To investigate unexplained bleeding or excessive bruising. 
• To assess the risk of bleeding before surgery or other medical procedures. 
• To monitor patients on anticoagulant medications like warfarin. 
• To diagnose and monitor conditions that affect blood clotting, such as hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 
• To evaluate liver disease, as the liver produces many of the proteins involved in blood clotting. 

d) Hb Electrophoresis / HPLC : Tests fot the percentage of various types of Hemoglobin.  Helps in diagnosing diseases like Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Diseasee

e) Bone Marrow Aspiration / Biopsy:
Is the cytological / histopathological examination of the bone marrow to diagnose  various blood and bone marrow disorders including cancers.

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">B. BIOCHEMISTRY</h2>
  Biochemistry in medical laboratories plays a crucial role in diagnosing, monitoring, and managing diseases. It involves the analysis of chemical substances and processes in the human body, focusing on understanding the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of health and disease.

Key Functions of Biochemistry in Medical Labs :
• Blood glucose tests for diabetes.
• Liver function tests (e.g., ALT, AST, bilirubin etc ).
• Kidney function tests (e.g., urea, creatinine etc ).
• Cardiac markers (e.g., troponin, CK-MB) for heart attacks.
• Electrolyte panels (Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻) for fluid balance.
• HbA1c levels for long-term glucose control in diabetics.
• Cholesterol panels to monitor lipid-lowering therapy.
• Tumor markers to track cancer progression (e.g., PSA, CA-125).
• Inherited metabolic disorders.
• Hormone Assays like Thyroid function tests to detect hypo/hyperthyroidism 
• Prenatal screening for genetic or developmental conditions.
• Therapeutic drug monitoring (e.g.,Valproate, lithium).
• Toxic substance screening (e.g., ethanol, heavy metals).



Common biochemistry panels:

Liver Function Tests / LFT :
Liver function tests are blood tests that assess the health and functioning of the liver by measuring specific substances it produces or processes.

Commonly measured substances in LFT: 
1. Enzymes: Alanine transaminase (ALT), Aspartate transaminase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT).
GGT is the earliest marker to show liver disease.
AST/ALT ratio: helps in diagnosing alcoholic liver disease.
2.  Proteins: Albumin, Globulin, Total protein.
3.  Waste Products: Total,  direct and indirect bilirubin.

Purpose
a. Monitoring: LFTs can be used to monitor the progression of liver disease or the effectiveness of treatment.
b. Screening: LFTs can be used to screen for liver infections like hepatitis.
c. Evaluating Medications: LFTs can help determine if certain medications are causing liver damage. 
No preparation is required for LFT

RENAL FUCTION TEST / KIDNEY FUNCTION TEST / KFT :
A renal function test, also known as a kidney function test , is a group of medical tests used to evaluate the health and efficiency of your kidneys. These tests measure levels of various substances in the blood to assess how well your kidneys are filtering waste products, balancing fluids and electrolytes, and producing essential hormones. 
Renal Function Tests include:
>Creatinine
>Urea. and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):
>BUN / Creatinine ratio : This ratio helps doctors determine if kidney issues are due to a problem with blood flow to the kidneys or an actual kidney malfunction. 
> Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR): Estimates how well your kidneys are filtering blood.
>Electrolytes: Sodium, potassium, chloride, ionic calcium
>Total Proteins, Albumin ,  Globulin and A/G ratio:
Total protein and Albumin decreases in chronic kidney disease.
>Total Calcium and Phosphorus:
In renal failure, disrupted calcium and phosphate imbalance leads to hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcaemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism, impacting bone health and increasing cardiovascular risk.
Ionic calcium  gives added advantage as it helps in detecting pseudo-hypocalcaemia cases.
> Uric Acid 



Purpose: The renal function test is ordered

>To assess renal health in patients with diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, liver diseases and other conditions that can affect the kidney.

Preparation - No preparation is required. Sample can be given anytime of the day.

Lipid Profile :
◦ A lipid profile test, also known as a lipid panel, is a blood test that measures the levels of different types of fats (lipids) in the blood, including cholesterol and triglycerides. The test measures:

• Total cholesterol: The sum of all cholesterol types in the blood. 
• LDL cholesterol (Low-density lipoprotein) : Often referred to as "bad cholesterol" as high levels can contribute to atherosclerosis in arteries. 
• HDL cholesterol (High-density lipoprotein): Known as "good cholesterol" as it helps remove LDL from the bloodstream. 
• Triglycerides: A type of fat that the body uses for energy. 
• VLDL cholesterol (Very low-density lipoprotein): A type of lipoprotein that carries triglycerides. 
• Cholesterol / HDL ratio : The higher the ratio , the more risk of heart disease
• Non-HDL Cholesterol :This refers to all cholesterol which is not good and promotes atherosclerosis

Purpose : 
It's a crucial screening tool for assessing and identifying risk factors
for diseases like heart attack and brain stroke in Individuals with a  positive family history of heart disease or stroke, in obese patients, those with a sedentary life style and smokers

◦Preparation :  Overnight fasting state (8-10hrs) is preferable for  giving blood sample. Non fasting samples is accepted only from patients who have been advised so by the treating physician.

Thyroid function tests (TFT)
TFT are a group of blood tests used to assess how well the thyroid gland is working. These tests help diagnose and monitor thyroid conditions like hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).
Tests include
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), FreeT3, and FreeT4.
Preparation : Morning sample in fasting state is preferable. For patients on thyroid medications, sample is taken before taking thyroid medicines.

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">C. SEROLOGY</h2>
  Serology is the scientific study of blood / serum  with regard to the response of the immune system to pathogens and is used in medical diagnostics to detect the presence of antibodies or antigens in a patient’s blood.

Types of Antibodies Detected:
IgM – Indicates recent or acute infection.
IgG – Indicates past exposure or long-term immunity.
IgA -  Crucial for mucosal immunity as in the respiratory and digestive system 
IgE – Crucial for allergic diseases

Main Applications:
1. Diagnosis of infections
Detect antibodies (IgM, IgG) against viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites.
Common in diseases like HIV, Hepatitis, Typhoid, Malaria,  COVID-19, Syphilis, and more.

2. Blood typing and compatibility testing 
A, B, AB, O and Rh positive or negative
Essential in blood transfusion and organ transplantation.

3. Autoimmune disease testing
Detects autoantibodies, e.g., ANA (antinuclear antibodies) for SLE,  RA factor for Rheumatoid Arthritis

4. Vaccine response monitoring
Measures antibody levels post-vaccination to ensure immunity like in Covid, Hepatitis B etc.

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">D. MICROBIOLOGY</h2>
  Microbiology in Medical Diagnostics is a vital branch of laboratory medicine focused on detecting and identifying microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) that cause infectious diseases. It supports clinical decision-making by guiding diagnosis, treatment, infection control, and prevention strategies.

Key Roles of Microbiology in Medical Diagnostics

1  Detection of Pathogens :
Identifying bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections. like  tuberculosis, COVID-19, UTIs, malaria, sepsis, etc.
Methods of detection:
a) Microscopy:  Direct visualization using stains (e.g., Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen, KOH preparation).
b) Serology:  Detects antibodies or antigens (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis B).
c) Molecular Techniques:   PCR, RT-PCR for DNA/RNA detection (e.g., COVID-19, TB, HPV).
d) Rapid Antigen Tests: Quick detection of pathogens like influenza, malaria
e) Culture
A culture involves growing a sample of tissue or fluid in a special medium to identify the infectious agent and then testing its susceptibility to various drugs.

2. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (Sensitivity)  Determines which antibiotics / drugs are effective against a specific pathogen.
Helps prevent antibiotic resistance by supporting appropriate therapy

Common Types of Culture and Sensitivity Tests: 
1. Urine culture: Used to detect urinary tract infections (UTIs).
2. Blood culture: Used to detect bloodstream infections (bacteremia or fungemia).
3. Pus  culture: Used to identify infections in wounds or skin and soft tissue.
4. Sputum culture: Used to detect respiratory infections.
5. Stool culture: Used to detect gastrointestinal infections.
6. Throat swab culture: Used to detect throat infections.
7. Conjunctival swab culture : done for eye infections
8. HVS (High Vaginal Swab) test and culture is a medical procedure used in  gynecology to collect a sample of vaginal discharge for testing. The sample is analyzed to identify potential infections, such as bacterial vaginosis and vaginal thrush.


  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">E. CYTOLOGY & HISTOPATHOLOGY</h2>
  Cytology  is the study of individual cells to detect disease, especially cancer and infections. It is a key tool in pathology that focuses on the microscopic examination of cells to identify abnormalities in their appearance, size, shape, and organization.

Main Purpose of Cytology in Diagnostics
• Early detection of cancer (e.g., cervical, lung, breast).
• Screening for precancerous lesions.
• Diagnosis of infections (e.g., viral, fungal).

Advantages of Cytology
• Minimally invasive or non-invasive.
• Quick turnaround time for results.
• Cost-effective and widely accessible.
• Early detection of malignancy and infections.

Types of Cytological Tests :
a)  Exfoliative Cytology:
Cells are naturally shed or collected from epithelial surfaces.
Example: Cervical Pap smear
Cervical Pap smear is a screening procedure used to check for abnormal cells on the cervix that could indicate cervical cancer or pre-cancerous changes. It involves collecting cells from the cervix and examining them under a microscope. ICMR suggests regular Pap smear screenings, for women aged 21 and older every 3 years and if combined with HPV testing then every 5 yrs.
Purpose:
1) Screening for cervical cancer: The primary purpose is to detect abnormal cells that could lead to cervical cancer before it develops.
2) Detecting infections. It can also help diagnose infections like those caused by HPV, which is a major cause of cervical cancer.  It also helps to differentiate viral , fungal and certain bacterial infections.
Procedure:
A small disposable and sterile brush or a spatula is used to collect cells from the cervix. Whole procedure is done under aseptic conditions by a Gynaecologist  or a Pathologist.  The collected cells are then  microscopically examined by the Pathologist in the  laboratory.
• It's recommended to avoid sexual intercourse, tampons, douches, or vaginal creams for 1-2 days before the test. 
• It's best to schedule the test after bleeding has ended in the menstrual cycle.

b) Aspirational Cytology (FNAC)
• Cells are aspirated using a fine needle from lumps or masses.
• Example: Breast lump, thyroid nodule.

Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is a minimally invasive procedure used to collect a small sample of cells from a lump or mass for microscopic examination.
Purpose:
• To determine if a lump or mass is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). 

Procedure:
• A thin needle is inserted into the lump or mass.
• Cells are extracted from the tissue.
• The sample is then examined under a microscope by the pathologist. 

Common uses:
• Breast lumps.
• Thyroid nodules.
• Enlarged lymph nodes.
• Salivary gland swellings.
• Superficial Soft tissue mass in any part of body
• For deeper lumps or which are not easily palpable, ultrasound guided facility for FNA is also available.

Benefits:
• Minimally invasive and less painful than other biopsy methods.
• Fast and relatively inexpensive.
• Can be performed in an outpatient setting. You can usually return to your normal activities  after the procedure
preparation
•   No preparation is required.

c)   Fluid Cytology
 Examines cells in body fluids.
  Examples:
  - Pleural fluid (chest) /  Peritoneal fluid (abdomen) 
  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (brain/spinal cord)  
 - Urine cytology for bladder cancer detection
 - Semen Analysis 



Histopathology is the branch of pathology that involves the study of tissues under a microscope to identify diseases, especially cancer and other abnormalities.
Process:
• Biopsy/Surgical Removal: Tissue samples are obtained via biopsy or surgery.
• The tissue is preserved using a fixative, typically formalin. The sample is embedded in paraffin wax to allow thin slicing. Very thin slices (around 4–5 µm thick) are cut using a microtome. The sections are the stained (commonly with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)) to differentiate structures.
• Microscopy: A pathologist examines the stained tissue under a light microscope.
• Immunohistochemistry (IHC): Uses antibodies to detect specific antigens in tissues.

Applications:
• Diagnosis of cancer, infections, and inflammatory diseases like nephritis in kidneys and hepatitis in liver.
• Evaluation of transplanted organs
• Forensic pathology

<div class="whitespace-pre-line text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">A. Digital X-rays (Radiograph)</h2>

  <p>Radiography is a type of imaging that uses electromagnetic radiation to view the inside of the body, especially bones and certain tissues. It is a fast, painless, and non-invasive diagnostic tool commonly used in medicine and dentistry. When computers are used to capture and display the images it is called digital radiography.</p>

  <p>At Sachdeva Diagnostics we use a High Frequency 600mA Xray Machine from Medtronics and the topend AGFA CR System for the digital X-rays.</p>

  <h3 class="font-semibold">Safety Note:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>X-rays involve ionizing radiation, but the dose is generally very low, especially when high powered x-ray machines are used. The dose further reduces in digital radiography.</li>
    <li>Not recommended for pregnant women unless absolutely necessary. It is done after covering the baby with a lead shield.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-semibold mt-2">Common Types of X-rays:</h3>

  <h4 class="font-semibold">1. Plain X-rays :</h4>
  <p>• Chest X-ray : To examine lungs, heart, and chest wall.</p>

  <p>• Dental X-rays : To assess teeth, bone loss, cavities, or root problems.</p>
  <p>• Bone X-rays : To detect fractures, dislocations, or arthritis.</p>
  <p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Most plain xrays do not require any preparation and can be done any time. Except plain Xray of the KUB region where you are asked to take a laxative one night prior and come empty stomach the next day after your bowel has nicely cleared.</p>

  <h4 class="font-semibold mt-2">2. Special X-rays:</h4>
  <p><strong>Orthopantomogram (OPG):</strong></p>
  <p>Panoramic dental X-ray for full jaw and teeth. Key Features:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>Panoramic View: Captures the entire mouth in a single image.</li>
    <li>Non-invasive: The patient simply stands biting on a mouthpiece; the machine rotates around their head.</li>
    <li>Quick and Painless: Usually takes less than a minute.</li>
    <li>Low Radiation: Relatively low dose compared to other radiographic methods.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Uses of OPG :</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>Evaluating tooth development and eruption patterns.</li>
    <li>Detecting impacted teeth (e.g., wisdom teeth).</li>
    <li>Planning for orthodontic treatments.</li>
    <li>Identifying jaw fractures, tumors, cysts, or infections.</li>
    <li>Assessing the bone structure for dental implants.</li>
    <li>Checking for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="font-semibold mt-2">3. Contrast Xray Studies:</h4>
  <p>• Xray studies after using a contrast medium: IVP (intravenous pyelography), barium studies, HSG (Hysterosalpingography), sonogram / fistulogram.</p>

  <p><strong>HSG</strong> stands for Hysterosalpingography — a special type of X-ray procedure used primarily to evaluate the uterus and fallopian tubes in women, especially in cases of infertility.</p>
  <p><strong>When Is It Done?</strong> Typically performed between days 7 and 10 of a woman’s menstrual cycle (after menstruation, before ovulation).</p>
  <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A cannula is passed into the cervix and contrast is injected through the cannula and xrays are taken subsequently.</p>
  <p>At Sachdeva Diagnostics the procedure is done by Dr Savita Sachdeva who has a vast experience of doing nearly five thousand HSG procedures in the last 20 years.</p>

  <p><strong>Intravenous Pyelography (IVP)</strong> is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the urinary tract, including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, by using a contrast dye and X-rays.</p>
  <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>Detect location of Urinary Tract obstruction as in kidney stones or urinary tract tumor</li>
    <li>Investigate frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs)</li>
    <li>Assess structural abnormalities in the urinary tract</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>You may be asked to fast for several hours and take a laxative to clear your bowels.</li>
    <li><strong>Injection:</strong> A contrast dye is injected into a vein, usually in your arm.</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging:</strong> As the dye travels through your bloodstream to the kidneys and urinary tract, X-rays are taken at timed intervals.</li>
    <li><strong>Observation:</strong> The dye outlines the urinary structures, allowing doctors to observe their shape, size, and function.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>Allergic reaction to the contrast dye (rare but possible)</li>
    <li>Not ideal for people with poor kidney function or iodine allergy</li>
    <li>Radiation exposure, though generally low</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-semibold mt-2">Barium studies</h3>
  <p>Barium studies are a group of diagnostic imaging tests that use barium sulfate, a contrast material, to help visualize parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</p>

  <p><strong>Types of Barium Studies</strong></p>
  <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
    <li><strong>Barium Swallow (Esophagogram)</strong>
      <p>• Examines: Pharynx and esophagus</p>
      <p>• Used for: Difficulty swallowing, GERD, strictures, tumors</p>

    <li>For lower GI: Laxatives or enemas to cleanse the colon</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">B. Ultrasound Scan (also called a Sonogram)</h2>

  <p>An ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging test that uses high-frequency sound waves to create real-time images of structures inside the body.</p>

  <h3 class="font-semibold">How It Works:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>A device called a transducer emits sound waves.</li>
    <li>These waves bounce off tissues and organs.</li>
    <li>The returning echoes are captured and turned into images on a monitor.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-semibold">Key Features:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>No radiation (unlike X-rays or CT scans)</li>
    <li>Safe for pregnant women and babies</li>
    <li>Provides real-time imaging (great for observing motion, like fetal heartbeat)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Sachdeva Diagnostics we use the latest technology RS 85 Prestige Whole Body Ultrasound Scan System from SAMSUNG; fully equipped with an array of probes: Convex, High frequency Linear, Intracavitary (TVS, TRUS) and 3D/4D.</p>

  <h3 class="font-semibold">Common Uses of Ultrasound:</h3>
  <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
    <li>Obstetric: Monitor pregnancy, fetal growth, heartbeat, and position.</li>
    <li>Pelvic: Evaluate uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder.</li>
    <li>Abdominal: Examine liver, kidneys, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen.</li>
    <li>KUB: assess kidneys, urinary bladder, prostate.</li>
    <li>Vascular/ Colour Doppler: Check blood flow in arteries and veins.</li>
    <li>Musculoskeletal: Look at muscles, joints, tendons, or soft tissue masses.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="font-semibold mt-2">Specialized Ultrasounds:</h3>

  <p><strong>1. 3D/4D Ultrasound:</strong> shows organs / fetus in a three dimensional view.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Transvaginal/Transrectal Ultrasound:</strong> Provides close-up internal views using special probes.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Color Doppler</strong> is a specialized type of ultrasound imaging that shows the flow of blood through blood vessels — including arteries and veins — using color-coded visuals.</p>

  <p><strong>Purpose of a Color Doppler:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>Assess blood flow direction, speed, and volume.</li>
    <li>Detect blockages, narrowing or clots.</li>
    <li>Check fetal blood circulation in pregnancy.</li>
    <li>Monitor organ perfusion (e.g., kidneys, liver, testicles).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Common Uses:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</li>
    <li>Varicose Veins</li>
    <li>Carotid artery evaluation (stroke risk)</li>
    <li>Pregnancy: check placental and fetal blood flow</li>
    <li>Liver or kidney transplant assessment</li>
    <li>Testicular torsion evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-semibold mt-2">4. Shearwave Ultrasound (Shearwave Elastography)</h3>
  <p>Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) is an advanced, non-invasive imaging technique that measures tissue stiffness using ultrasound-generated shear waves. It’s especially useful for assessing liver fibrosis, tumors, and muscle conditions.</p>

  <p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>The ultrasound probe sends acoustic pulses into the tissue.</li>
    <li>These pulses generate shear waves.</li>
    <li>The machine tracks how fast these waves move through the tissue:</li>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
      <li>Faster waves = stiffer tissue</li>
      <li>Slower waves = softer tissue</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The result is a color-coded map of stiffness (an elastogram) over a conventional ultrasound image.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Common Uses</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>Liver: (Fibroscan) Assess fibrosis and cirrhosis (e.g., hepatitis B/C, NAFLD)</li>
    <li>Breast: Alternative to biopsy in many cases. Distinguish benign vs. malignant lesions</li>
    <li>Thyroid: Evaluate suspicious nodules</li>
    <li>Prostate: Guide biopsies, assess stiffness in cancer-suspicious regions</li>
    <li>Muscles & Tendons: Detect strain, tear, or scar tissue</li>
    <li>Lymph nodes & tumors: benign vs malignant</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-semibold mt-2">5. Fat Quantification (QUS)</h3>
  <p>It assesses the amount of fat in the liver by two techniques: TAI (tissue attenuation index) called by various names like CAP or UGAP value and TSI (tissue scattering index) and then combines the two to give a Fat Fraction % (UDFF).</p>
  <p>Shearwave Ultrasound and Fat Quantification are used together to study the liver. While most centres just give the tissue attenuation value (CAP / UGAP), at Sachdeva Diagnostics we use the top end machines which gives the Fat Fraction (UDFF%) also along with the tissue attenuation value.</p>
